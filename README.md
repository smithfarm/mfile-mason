mfile-mason
===========

"Creaky old application gets third life with HTML::Mason"

Rising out of the ashes of a failed attempt to rewrite my minimalistic
'mfile' database application using JavaScript, Erlang, and the ChicagoBoss
framework, the latest incarnation still uses JavaScript on the client side,
but the server now uses Apache, mod_perl and HTML::Mason to render pages.
